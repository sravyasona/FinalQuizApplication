INTRODUCTION:

Mobile Computing is very popular and almost present everywhere. Nowadays,
smartphones are the tools in our society to communicate with other people,
Entertainment and many more. Smartphone development became important
than before. Android is one of the best leading operating systems for smart-
phones. It is also an open-source system platform. Many of the smartphones
adopt this platform to work on more development projects. We proposed a quiz
application design based on Android. The main goal of the paper is for students
participating in learning the knowledge of different topics by attempting some
quiz questions related to their interest area. This app will help the students for 
the general knowledge foundation by using mobile computing.



Application has many of the main functions. The application has the login page,
where an application starts the activity with the login page. After entering the
login details of the user, then it intents to the other activity. The first intent
activity is the main activity. It is the main activity that has a categorical view of
the list of interest topics. After selecting the interest topics, mobile application
checks with the internet connection. If there is no internet connection then the
app stops, as there is no internet connection. If the application has the internet
application then it intent to the next activity. This activity named quiz activity.
Where quiz activity has the main function to display the questions also the
answers. If there are no questions displayed then there is a problem with the
server response. After pressing the answer, We get a toast message whether the
answer is correct or wrong. By this, the user can know whether the answer is
correct or wrong. After completion of answering all the questions. Then this
activity ends and starts with other activities. That activity is called Result
activity. The resulting activity's main functionality of the code is too display
the result of the questions. There is a small button function code is added if
a user is interested in doing the quiz again. He can choose to click the menu
button where it redirects to the main page of the category list.
